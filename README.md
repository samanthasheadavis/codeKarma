#### Iron Yard Capstone Project

Code Karma is a platform built in December 2016 to encourage the open source community to change the world around them.

#### Features

* **Two-sided platform** - Code Karma's two-sided interface makes it possible for clients and developers to designate their role upon sign-in.
* **GitHub API Integration** - Code Karma leverages the GitHub API to make collaboration between nonprofits and developers simple and straightforward.
* **Karma points** - The Karma Points algorithm awards points based on a developer's activity on Code Karma, incentivizing activities like asking and responding to questions, or making contributions to nonprofit projects.

#### Functionality

* Nonprofit clients sign on with their GitHub account and create, edit and delete projects. By providing essential details and a valid Github repository, clients can generate new projects quickly and easily.
* Developers sign on and are directed to their dashboard, where their stats and skills are displayed.
* On the **All Projects** page developers are able to see the title, type and description of each available client project as well as the primary languages used.
  * Projects are searchable at the top of the page.
  * The Details button provides additional information for each project, including the Extended Description, Active Site URL, Github Repository, and the Client’s contact email.
  * Developers can fork a client project by clicking the **Fork** button, which creates a forked repository of the original project on GitHub.
* The **My Projects** page shows all of the developer's forked projects. Here, the developer can set a completion date and provide general estimates on their progress. Both metrics are adjustable, and can be updated at any time by the developer.
  * When a Developer indicates that a Project is 100% complete, they have the option of Submitting a **Pull Request**. To submit a pull request, Developers select Branches, provided by the Github API, which correspond to the live Github Repositories of the client and the developer.
* During the development process, Developers can ask for help in the **Community Feed**. The Community Feed provides a common forum for Developers to share questions and solutions.
